PDRC-190#1 Warning
Suboptimally placed synchronized register chain  
The FDRE cell system_i/imageProcess/SketchIP_1080p_0/inst/OB/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gaxis_fifo.gaxisf.axisf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d2_reg in site SLICE_X5Y9 is part of a synchronized register chain that is suboptimally placed as the load FDSE cell system_i/imageProcess/SketchIP_1080p_0/inst/OB/U0/inst_fifo_gen/gaxis_fifo.gaxisf.axisf/grf.rf/rstblk/grstd1.grst_full.grst_f.rst_d3_reg is not placed in the same (SLICE) site.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock axi_clk is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks axi_clk and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks axi_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and axi_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks axi_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks axi_clk and clk_fpga_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks axi_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and axi_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks axi_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock axi_clk is created on an inappropriate internal pin system_i/imageProcess/SketchIP_1080p_0/inst/axi_clk. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#2 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin system_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
